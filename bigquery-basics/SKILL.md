# BigQuery Basics

BigQuery is a serverless, AI-ready data platform that enables high-speed
analysis of large datasets using SQL and Python. Its disaggregated architecture
separates compute and storage, allowing them to scale independently while
providing built-in machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business
intelligence capabilities.

## Setup and Basic Usage

1.  **Enable the BigQuery API:**

    ```bash
    gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com --quiet
    ```

2.  **Create a Dataset:**

    ```bash
    bq mk --dataset --location=US my_dataset
    ```

3.  **Create a Table:**

    Create a file named `schema.json` with your table schema:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "name",
        "type": "STRING",
        "mode": "REQUIRED"
      },
      {
        "name": "post_abbr",
        "type": "STRING",
        "mode": "NULLABLE"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Then create the table with the `bq` tool:

    ```bash
    bq mk --table my_dataset.mytable schema.json
    ```

4.  **Run a Query:**

    ```bash
    bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
    'SELECT name FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013` \
    WHERE state = "TX" LIMIT 10'
    ```
