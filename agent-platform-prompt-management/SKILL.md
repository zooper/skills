# Agent Platform Prompt Management

## Usage Guide

To use this skill effectively:

1. **Generate Code**: Provide the Python snippets below to the user to help them
manage prompts in Agent Platform.

2. **No File System Search**: Do not try to find Python files or scripts on the
file system for these operations.

## Safety & Confirmation Tiers (CRITICAL)

Before executing any commands or scripts on behalf of the user, you must adhere
to the following safety tiers based on the action requested, to prevent
accidental mutation or permanent deletion of prompt resources:

1.  **Tier R: Read-only (`list`, `get`)**
    *   No confirmation needed. Execute immediately to gather information.
2.  **Tier M: Mutating & Reversible (`create`)**
    *   Requires **interactive confirmation** with 'Yes'/'No' options
    before executing prompt creation, to prevent unintended resource
    proliferation or misconfiguration. The confirmation prompt must
    clearly explain the proposed prompt creation and its key parameters
    (e.g., display name, template text, target model). Natural-language
    paraphrases without specifying the parameters are not sufficient.
    *   **Same-turn restriction**: Do not execute the creation code in the same
        turn as presenting the confirmation prompt. Stop and wait for the user's
        reply; only execute after explicit 'Yes' / approval.
    *   **Gold Standard Example**:
        > I will create a prompt in Agent Platform with the following
        > parameters. Please confirm this information before I proceed:
        > *   **Display Name**: `Customer Support Greeting`
        > *   **Target Model**: `gemini-2.5-pro`
        > *   **Template Text**: "Hello {{user_name}}, how can I help..."
        > Do you confirm? [Yes/No]
3.  **Tier D: Destructive & Irreversible (`delete`)**
    *   Requires **explicit typed confirmation** (e.g. "I confirm" or "Yes,
    delete it") before executing prompt deletion, to prevent accidental
    permanent loss of production prompt assets. Ask for confirmation
    before any pre-flight checks.
    *   **Same-turn restriction**: NEVER execute in the same turn as asking for
        typed confirmation. Wait for the user to reply in a new turn.
    *   **Gold Standard Example**:
        > I will permanently delete the following prompt from Agent Platform.
        > This action is irreversible. Please explicitly type your
        > confirmation (e.g., "I confirm") before I proceed:
        > *   **Prompt ID**: `prompt_12345abc`
        > *   **Display Name**: `Legacy Outdated Prompt`
        > Please type your confirmation to proceed.

## Phase 0: Environment Setup

**CRITICAL**: Before the user runs any of the Python snippets below, you MUST
advise them to ensure the environment is correctly initialized by following
these steps:

1. **Google Cloud Authentication**: Authenticate with your Google Cloud account
   and configure active Application Default Credentials (ADC) for Agent
   Platform access:
   
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
2. **Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a dedicated virtual environment:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/prompt_agent_venv
   source ~/prompt_agent_venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Agent Platform SDKs:
   
   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-genai
   ```
4. **Execution**: Advise the user that every time they execute a Python snippet, they must ensure this virtual environment is activated first.

> [!TIP] **Placeholder Parameter Replacement:** The Python scripts below use
> uppercase string placeholders (like `"PROJECT_ID"`, `"LOCATION_ID"`, and
> `"PROMPT_ID"`). You **MUST** dynamically replace these placeholders with the
> actual Project ID, Region, and Prompt ID values provided in the user's prompt
> (or discovered context) before generating or providing the scripts.

## 1. Managing Prompts via Agent Platform SDK

The SDK provides a high-level `Prompt` class in the preview module.

### Create a Prompt

Use when you need to create a new managed prompt in Agent Platform.

*   **Reference**: See [create.md](references/create.md) for detailed instructions and Python snippets.

### List Prompts

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.preview import prompts

vertexai.init(project="PROJECT_ID", location="LOCATION_ID")

all_prompts = prompts.list()
for p in all_prompts:
    print(f"Name: {p.display_name}, ID: {p.prompt_id}")
```

### Retrieve and Use a Prompt

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.preview import prompts

vertexai.init(project="PROJECT_ID", location="LOCATION_ID")

retrieved_prompt = prompts.get(prompt_id="PROMPT_ID")
# Versions are supported: prompts.get(prompt_id="PROMPT_ID", version_id="2")

# Assemble with variables (kwargs must match template variable names)
assembled = retrieved_prompt.assemble_contents(text="The quick brown fox...")
print(assembled)
```

### Delete a Prompt

**CRITICAL**: You must pass the numeric prompt ID (e.g., `"1234567890123456789"`)
to `prompts.delete()`. The SDK constructs the full resource path internally
using the project and location from `vertexai.init()`.

**Confirmation Required**: As a Tier D (Destructive) operation, the agent MUST
pause and request explicit, high-friction typed re-confirmation of the prompt ID
from the user before generating or providing the deletion code.
The action is irreversible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NEVER pre-emptively provide or execute any deletion code before receiving
> the user's response in a new turn.** You must never speculate or assume that
> confirmation will be given. Asking for confirmation and providing the code in
> a single parallel turn is a severe safety violation.

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.preview import prompts

vertexai.init(project="PROJECT_ID", location="LOCATION_ID")

prompts.delete(prompt_id="PROMPT_ID")
```

## 2. Best Practices

-   **Idempotency**:
    *   **Tier R** (List, Get): Inherently idempotent.
    *   **Tier D** (Delete): Re-running a delete on a non-existent or already
        deleted resource returns NOT_FOUND. Treat this as success.
-   **Placeholders**: Use the standard placeholder syntax (variable name
    enclosed in double curly braces) in your prompt templates.
-   **Versioning**: Always tag or record version IDs when making updates to
    production prompts.
-   **Model Reference**: Specify the target model ID (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`)
    when creating the prompt to ensure consistency.
-   **Underlying Schema**: When using the Dataset API, always use the correct
    `metadata_schema_uri` and nested `metadata` structure to ensure the prompt
    is recognized by Agent Platform Studio and the Prompts SDK.
